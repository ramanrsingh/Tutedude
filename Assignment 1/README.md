# Assignment 1

This folder contains two Python tasks.

## Task 1 - Calculator

This program does basic math operations with two numbers.

First, it asks you to enter two numbers. It converts them to float so you can use decimals if you want.

Then it calculates:
- Addition (adds the two numbers)
- Subtraction (subtracts second number from first)
- Multiplication (multiplies them)
- Division (divides first by second)

Finally, it prints all four results.

## Task 2 - Name Greeting

This program greets you using your name.

It asks for your first name and last name separately. Then it combines them with a space in between to make your full name.

After that, it prints a welcome message that says "Hello, [your full name]! Welcome to the Python program"

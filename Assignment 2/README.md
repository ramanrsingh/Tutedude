# Assignment 2

This folder contains two Python tasks.

## Task 1 - Even or Odd Checker

This program checks if a number is even or odd.

It asks you to enter a number. Then it uses the modulo operator (%) to check if the number divided by 2 gives a remainder of 0.

If the remainder is 0, the number is even. Otherwise, it's odd. The program prints the result accordingly.

## Task 2 - Sum from 1 to 50

This program calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 50.

It starts with a sum variable set to 0. Then it uses a for loop that goes from 1 to 50 (using range(1,51) because range doesn't include the last number).

For each number in that range, it adds it to the sum. After the loop finishes, it prints the total sum.

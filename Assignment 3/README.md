# Assignment 3

This folder contains two Python tasks.

## Task 1 - Factorial Calculator

This program calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.

It asks you to enter a number. Then it calls a function called factorial that works like this:

If the number is 1, it just returns 1. Otherwise, it multiplies the number by the factorial of (number - 1). This keeps going until it reaches 1.

For example, factorial of 5 is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120. The function calls itself with smaller numbers until it hits the base case of 1.

## Task 2 - Math Operations

This program does three different math operations on a number using Python's math module.

First it imports the math module. Then it asks you to enter a number (can be a decimal).

It calculates:
- Square root using math.sqrt()
- Natural logarithm (log base e) using math.log()
- Sine value using math.sin()

Finally it prints all three results.
